This research is focused on developing a psychometric test for evaluating aural skills in a music production context.
Working with professional, amateur, and lay participants in the Atlanta area, we will measure their performance on a variety of audio recognition and manipulation tasks, with the goal of developing concise inventory of question for predicting aural ability.
Participants will volunteer for two experimental sessions: the first session will be conducted in person, and last about 90 minutes;
parsticipants will work in a custom audio processing interface to manipulate audio files to match targets.
A second (remote) session will occur 2--7 days later, consisting of a simple multiple-choice question and answers in a web interface.
