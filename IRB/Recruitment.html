<p>Hi <code>___</code></p>
<p>We are looking for volunteers to participate in an online experiment we are conducting concerning the quality of mixes in popular music. We’d love it if you would be willing to help us out! The study should only take about 30–40 minutes of your time. Unfortunately, there would be no compensation to you, other than the good feeling of helping science!</p>
<p>Only adults (18 years or older) who are currently <em>in</em> the USA may participate. If you meet these criteria and are interested in participating, please navigate to <a href="https://ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/Mixing/interface.html">ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/Mixing/interface.html</a>. If you have any questions or problems, contact Rosa Westfall at <a href="mailto:rwestfall6@gatech.edu">rwestfall6@gatech.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Nat Condit-Schultz Rosa Westfall</p>
