Hi `___`

We are looking for volunteers to participate in an online experiment we are conducting concerning the aural (ear) skills 
We'd love it if you would be willing to help us out!
The study should require two sessions, one in person and one remote.
Unfortunately, there would be no compensation to you, other than the good feeling of helping science!

Only adults (18 years or older) may participate.
If you are interested in participating, please contact Rosa Westfall at [rwestfall6@gatech.edu](mailto:rwestfall6@gatech.edu).

Thanks!

Rosa Westfall
Nat Condit-Schultz
