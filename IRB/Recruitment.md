Hi `___`

We are looking for volunteers to participate in an online experiment we are conducting concerning rhythm pedagogy.
The study is conducted online and consists of only one half-hour session.
During the study, you will interact with an app which teaches you how to clap common rhythmic patterns.
We'd love it if you would be willing to help us out!
Unfortunately, there would be no compensation to you, other than the good feeling of helping science!

Only adults (18 years or older) may participate.
If you are interested in participating, please contact Noel Alben at [noelalben@gatech.edu](mailto:noelalben@gatech.edu).

Thanks!

Noel Alben
